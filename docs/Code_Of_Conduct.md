# ExplainableAI Project Code of Conduct

## Welcome

Welcome to the **ExplainableAI** repository! This Python package provides tools for creating interpretable machine learning models by combining various explainable AI techniques with LLM-powered (Large Language Model) explanations. The goal is to make model predictions more understandable for both technical and non-technical users. We are committed to fostering an inclusive, respectful, and harassment-free environment for all contributors.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in **ExplainableAI** a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. Our commitment is to foster a collaborative environment where contributors of all backgrounds can come together to build explainable AI solutions.

## Our Standards

To ensure that everyone has a positive experience in the **ExplainableAI** project, all participants are expected to adhere to the following standards:

### Positive Behavior:
- **Respectful Communication**: Treat all participants with respect, ensuring that discussions remain professional, constructive, and helpful.
- **Constructive Feedback**: Provide feedback that focuses on improvement and learning, ensuring that suggestions are helpful and growth-oriented.
- **Collaboration**: Work together in a spirit of cooperation, sharing knowledge, and assisting others in solving problems.
- **Inclusivity**: Use language and behavior that welcomes all participants, creating an environment where everyone feels valued and included.
- **Recognition**: Acknowledge and celebrate the efforts and contributions of others, regardless of their experience or expertise.
- **Open Learning**: Encourage a learning environment where both technical and non-technical users feel comfortable asking questions and contributing.

### Unacceptable Behavior:
- **Harassment**: Any form of harassment, including unwelcome comments, personal attacks, or inappropriate behavior, is strictly prohibited.
- **Discrimination**: Discriminatory comments or behavior based on personal identity, beliefs, or background will not be tolerated.
- **Disrespect**: Dismissive, inflammatory, or derogatory comments that undermine constructive discussions are unacceptable.
- **Privacy Violations**: Sharing personal or private information about others without their explicit consent is not allowed.
- **Unethical Conduct**: Engaging in behavior that misuses the project’s resources, violates ethical standards, or promotes false or misleading information.
- **Disruption**: Actions that disrupt the collaborative and supportive nature of the project will not be tolerated.

## Project Goals

The **ExplainableAI** project aims to provide tools for making machine learning models more interpretable and understandable. The key goals of the project include:

- **Explainability**: Developing tools that combine various explainable AI techniques with LLM-powered explanations to make complex model predictions understandable for both technical and non-technical audiences.
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring that explainable AI techniques are accessible to a wide range of users, enabling them to gain insights into how machine learning models work.
- **Collaboration**: Encouraging contributions from data scientists, developers, and researchers to enhance explainability in machine learning.
- **Open Source Development**: Promoting an open-source development model where contributors can add to and improve the tools offered by **ExplainableAI**.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

The community leaders and maintainers of the **ExplainableAI** project are responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct. They are expected to:

- Define and communicate the standards for acceptable behavior and ensure that all participants are aware of them.
- Address violations of the Code of Conduct in a timely and fair manner.
- Take corrective action to remove or edit comments, posts, or contributions that violate the community’s standards.
- Apply disciplinary measures, such as temporary or permanent bans, in cases of repeated or severe violations of the Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by **ExplainableAI**, including GitHub repositories, issue trackers, discussions, and any other communication channels. It also applies when community members represent the project in public spaces, such as conferences, online events, or forums.

## Reporting Violations

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it by contacting the project maintainers via the project’s communication channels (e.g., GitHub issues, discussions). All complaints will be reviewed and addressed promptly and confidentially. The community leaders are committed to creating a safe environment and will take appropriate action to handle reported incidents.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

If a community member is found to have violated this Code of Conduct, the community leaders may take the following actions:

1. **Correction**: A private conversation with the individual to address the violation and provide guidance for improving behavior.
2. **Warning**: A formal warning that outlines the unacceptable behavior and future expectations.
3. **Temporary Suspension**: A temporary suspension from participating in the project or community spaces, with the possibility of reinstatement after review.
4. **Permanent Ban**: Permanent removal from the project and all community spaces for repeated or egregious violations.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these guidelines to determine the consequences for any action that violates this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction**:
   - **Community Impact**: A minor violation that causes minimal disruption.
   - **Consequence**: A private conversation to clarify the violation and provide guidance on behavior improvement.

2. **Warning**:
   - **Community Impact**: A moderate violation that negatively affects the project’s collaborative environment.
   - **Consequence**: A formal warning, with clear expectations for future behavior.

3. **Temporary Suspension**:
   - **Community Impact**: A significant violation that harms the integrity of the project or community interactions.
   - **Consequence**: Temporary suspension from participating in the project or contributing to community discussions.

4. **Permanent Ban**:
   - **Community Impact**: A severe or repeated violation that undermines the project’s goals or the values of the community.
   - **Consequence**: Permanent removal from the project and all related spaces.

## Building a Positive Community

At **ExplainableAI**, we are dedicated to creating a community that is welcoming, inclusive, and supportive of all contributors. By working together to build interpretable machine learning tools, we can ensure that AI models are accessible and understandable to a broad range of users. Let’s collaborate with respect, integrity, and a shared passion for building explainable AI solutions.
